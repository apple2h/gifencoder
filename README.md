**UPDATE**
Since version 1.2, Go has included an implementation of `Encode` and `EncodeAll` into the standard library.

The Go language has support for a lot of things in its library, including images.
Unfortunately half of the [GIF](http://golang.org/pkg/image/gif/) package is missing: you can only decode files, not
encode them. This repository aims to provide the `Encode` and `EncodeAll` functions
to complete the functionality.

Has support for static images and animations (use `Encode` for static images and
`EncodeAll` for animations), variable delay between frames and infinite looping.

I've tested the output in a few different viewers and they all rendered it
correctly, except for [HoneyView](http://www.honeyview.org/). I'm still not sure why, and any help is welcome.
